## Hipothesis: 
 * The highest percentage of shark attacks to surfers happened in California
 
### Why I chose that hipothesis:

Sharks are at the top of the food chain. The ocean predators follow their instincts. Humans are not sharks' favorite meal. But seems they have develop a special taste for surfers.

A shark has to make quick decisions to capture food and, sometimes, the predator misinterprets humans for its natural food item. Most of this situation happens in the surf areas near to the shore this is why surfer are their favourite human-shape-food.

In the last year the country with more shark attacks in the world was the US. The West Coast in  the US and specially California is the state with more places to surf in the US. 

The combination of the above can lead us to the conclusion that the **Highest percentage of attacks to surfers happen in California compared to other areas in the world**.

## Project description

Before composing a hipothesis I need to understand *what kind of data we have*: Step 1 and 2 in Cleanning Shark CSV

Once we have the hipothesis I need to *clean the data frame to have just the relevant info to investigate it*: Step 3 in Cleanning Shark CSV

When the data frame is clean I can start the *analysis phase*:
 - Identyfy the group for the analysis (Surfers in Califonia)
 - Compare the group with the general poulation
 - Compase the conclusion and explani it with some visual
